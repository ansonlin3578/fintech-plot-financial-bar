Complier(Tool): Visual studio code

Notes:
	1.All csv(Daily_2021_09_15~Daily_2021_10_04) need to in the "HW3_data" folder,
	  and the HW3_data foler need to in the same folder with HW3.py(.py code).
	2.Because I use Visual studio code and matplotlib.pyplot,so it will plot the "number of ticks".
      Once the figure appear, need to close the figure and let code countinue to run.
    3.execute the "HW3.py" will saved the image of "bar plots" and "number of ticks"
